- 👋 Hi, I’m @mxbrumer
- 👀 I’m interested in the application of statistical methods to address real-world problems within a buisness setting
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and SQL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything! I am excited to bring my knowledge of statistical methods to the table and help inform action for a variety of buisness needs
- 📫 Feel free to send me an email at maxbrumer@ou.edu
